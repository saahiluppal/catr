1. model changed from bert to bengali bert base while doing prediction.
2. hyperparam epoch changed to 5 because of time limitations.
3. in coco.py changed image_id -> filename as the JSON file provided in bengali dataset have filename as key.
4. in coco.py, multiple caption has been provided for single image, so we are considering first one only.
5. No annotation keys provided so getting rid of it.
6. for some unknown error (most probably image datas are lying in the zip file in seperate dirs as a result multiple 
   colab based soultion to uznip the file failed and I could unzip 1443 data to be exact, plus a pkg reporting there
   is a corrupt file) I have used 1443 data and 1243 for training limit.
7. zerofilling seems unnecessary for us...
8. switched pretrained model.
9. we are not using multiple data type only using png, so conversion to jpg seems unnecessary, although it won't hurt
   much if we convert it.
10. path changed in config file and limit also.
